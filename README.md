# Streamlit-project
# Intelligent OTT Platform System

## Project Description
This project introduces an advanced OTT platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies like Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and hybrid recommendation algorithms. It aims to revolutionize content management and personalization, offering dynamic and highly accurate movie recommendations tailored to individual users.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithms:**  
  Combines collaborative and content-based filtering using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for precise recommendations.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
  Analyzes user sentiments and comments to refine recommendations in real time.  
- **Real-Time Analytics:**  
  Tracks user behavior dynamically to adjust content offerings instantly.  
- **Streamlit User Interface:**  
  Provides an interactive and visually appealing platform for seamless navigation and interaction.  

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment Analysis  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  

## System Architecture
The system incorporates advanced architecture to ensure efficient processing and robust scalability. It includes:  
1. **Recommendation Engine:** Powered by ML algorithms for precise predictions.  
2. **Data Processing:** Real-time analysis of user interactions and viewing history.  
3. **Frontend:** Built using Streamlit for intuitive user experience.  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.  
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
3. Launch the application with `streamlit run app.py`.  
4. Use the user interface to explore recommendations and interact with the system.
